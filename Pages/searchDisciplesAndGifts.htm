        //Array with the 12 disciples and the 7 gifts of the holy spirit

        const keywords = [
            { name: 'Peter', info: "Peter, originally named Simon, was a fisherman and one of Jesus' closest disciples. He is known for his strong faith, yet also for his moments of weakness, such as when he denied Jesus three times. However, he was restored by Christ and became a leading figure in the early church, boldly preaching the gospel and teaching with conviction." },
            { name: 'James', info: "James, the son of Zebedee, was one of the first followers of Jesus and the brother of John. Along with Peter and John, he witnessed significant events like the Transfiguration of Jesus. James was martyred for his faith and is remembered for his dedication to the gospel." },
            { name: 'John', info: "John, the brother of James, was known as the 'beloved disciple' and had an especially close relationship with Jesus. He was present at many pivotal moments, such as the crucifixion and resurrection. John also wrote the gospel that bears his name and the letters found in the New Testament, highlighting God's love." },
            { name: 'Andrew', info: "Andrew, Peter's brother, was one of the first to follow Jesus and immediately shared the good news with his brother. While less mentioned than other disciples, he played an important role as an evangelist, bringing others to Christ as recorded in Scripture." },
            { name: 'Philip', info: "Philip was directly called by Jesus to follow Him. He was a practical and questioning disciple, and at one point asked Jesus to show the Father to the disciples. Philip is remembered for his eagerness to bring others to Jesus, like when he brought Nathanael to meet Christ." },
            { name: 'Bartholomew', info: "Bartholomew, also known as Nathanael, was called by Philip to follow Jesus. He is remembered for his sincere reaction when he encountered Jesus, declaring that no one could be like Him. Bartholomew remained faithful in his commitment to Christ and, according to tradition, served as a missionary after Jesus' ascension." },
            { name: 'Matthew', info: "Matthew, the tax collector, was called by Jesus to follow Him, leaving behind his lucrative job to follow the Master. He wrote the Gospel of Matthew, which focuses on presenting Jesus as the promised Messiah in the Scriptures. His conversion serves as an example of how Jesus reaches out to the lost." },
            { name: 'Thomas', info: "Thomas, also known as Didymus, is often remembered for his doubt after the resurrection of Jesus, when he initially refused to believe until he saw the marks in Christ's wounds. However, Thomas proclaimed one of the deepest confessions of faith, acknowledging Jesus as 'My Lord and my God.'" },
            { name: 'James son of Alphaeus', info: "James, the son of Alphaeus, is sometimes referred to as 'James the Less' to distinguish him from the more well-known James, the son of Zebedee. Not much is written about him in the Scriptures, but he is listed among the twelve apostles. He faithfully followed Jesus, and tradition holds that he preached the gospel in various regions after Christ's ascension." },
            { name: 'Thaddaeus', info: "Thaddaeus, also known as Lebbaeus or Judas the son of James, is another apostle with little direct mention in the Bible. He is known for asking Jesus a question during the Last Supper about why Jesus would reveal Himself only to the disciples and not to the world. Thaddaeus is believed to have carried the message of the gospel to distant lands and preached with devotion." },
            { name: 'Simon the Zealot', info: "Simon, often called 'the Zealot', was a member of a political movement known for its fervent opposition to Roman rule in Israel. He is mentioned in the lists of the twelve apostles but little else is known about his life or ministry. After Jesus' resurrection, Simon is believed to have spread the gospel, possibly in Persia, and was martyred for his faith." },
            { name: 'Judas Iscariot', info: "Judas Iscariot is one of the most infamous disciples, known for betraying Jesus to the religious authorities for thirty pieces of silver. His actions led to the arrest of Jesus and His eventual crucifixion. Judas's betrayal and subsequent regret are deeply significant in the narrative of Jesus' passion. After his betrayal, he took his own life, leaving behind a legacy of tragic disobedience." },
            { name: 'Wisdom', info: "The gift of wisdom allows a believer to see life from God's perspective. It enables them to make decisions in alignment with God's will and to understand divine truths that transcend human understanding. Wisdom helps in discerning the deeper meaning of Scripture and applying it to everyday situations."},
            { name: 'Understanding', info: "This gift allows a person to grasp the meaning of God's teachings and the mysteries of faith. It brings clarity and insight into God's Word, making it easier to understand and live according to His guidance. It empowers the believer to see beyond the surface and comprehend deeper spiritual truths."},
            { name: 'Counsel ', info: "The gift of counsel helps a believer make prudent decisions in life. It allows them to judge correctly and seek the will of God when faced with difficult choices. This gift provides guidance in moral decisions, helping one to choose what is righteous and pleasing to God."},
            { name: 'Fortitude', info: "Fortitude gives strength and courage to stand firm in faith, especially during trials and persecution. It empowers a believer to endure hardship for the sake of righteousness and to boldly live out their faith, even in the face of opposition."},
            { name: 'Knowledge', info: "The gift of knowledge enables a believer to understand the world in light of God's truth. It grants insight into the nature of God, the workings of creation, and the human condition. With this gift, a believer can recognize the true value of things and make choices that honor God."},
            { name: 'Piety', info: "Piety instills a deep sense of reverence and love for God. It leads to a heart of worship and devotion, cultivating a desire to live in accordance with God's will. This gift also helps to foster a genuine respect for others as children of God."},
            { name: 'Fear of the Lord', info: "The gift of fear of the Lord is not about being afraid, but about having a profound respect and awe for God's greatness. It fosters humility and a recognition of God's majesty, leading a person to live with a sense of awe and reverence before Him. It encourages a desire to avoid sin out of love and reverence for God."},
